### Gamma Distribution



```{r}
plot(dgamma(1:12, shape = 3, scale = 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Probability Density Function")

plot(pgamma(1:12, shape = 3, scale = 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Cummulative Distribution Function")
```

#### Log Transformation

```{r}
plot(dgamma(log(1:120), shape = 3, scale = 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Probability Density Function",
     ylab = "Y = log(x)")
mean(dgamma(log(1:120), shape = 3, scale = 1))
median(dgamma(log(1:120), shape = 3, scale = 1))

plot(pgamma(log(1:120), shape = 3, scale = 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Cummulative Distribution Function",
     ylab = "Y = log(x)")
mean(pgamma(log(1:120), shape = 3, scale = 1))
median(pgamma(log(1:120), shape = 3, scale = 1))
```


### Normal Distribution



```{r}
plot(dnorm(1:5, -1, 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Probability Density Function")

plot(pnorm(1:5, -1, 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Cummulative Distribution Function")
```

#### Log Transformation

```{r}
plot(dnorm(log(1:5), -1, 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Probability Density Function",
     ylab = "Y = log(x)")
mean(dnorm(log(1:5), -1, 1))
median(dnorm(log(1:5), -1, 1))

plot(pnorm(log(1:5), -1, 1),
     type = "l",
     main = "Cummulative Distribution Function",
     ylab = "Y = log(x)")
mean(pnorm(log(1:5), -1, 1))
median(pnorm(log(1:5), -1, 1))
```


### Uniform Distribution



```{r}
plot(dunif(1:18, 0, 12),
     type = "l",
     main = "Probability Density Function")
plot(punif(1:18, 0, 12),
     type = "l",
     main = "Cummulative Distribution Function")
```

#### Log Transformation

```{r}
plot(dunif(log(1:18), 0, 12),
     type = "l",
     main = "Probability Density Function",
     ylab = "Y = log(x)")
mean(dunif(log(1:18),0,12))
median(dunif(log(1:18), 0, 12))

plot(punif(log(1:18),0,12),
     type = "l",
     main = "Cummulative Distribution Function",
     ylab = "Y = log(x)")
mean(punif(log(1:18),0,12))
median(punif(log(1:18), 0, 12))
```
