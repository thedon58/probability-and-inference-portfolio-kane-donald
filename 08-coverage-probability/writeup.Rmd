# Introduction



# Generate a Sample of Size N From a Known Distribution

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
N <- 201
data <- rnorm(N)
xbar <- mean(data)
sdbar <- sd(data)
```

# Estimate Distribution

```{r}
hist(data,
     freq = FALSE,
     main = "Probability Density Function",
     breaks = 30,
     xlab = "Sample Data")
curve(dnorm(x,
            mean = xbar,
            sd = sdbar),
      add = TRUE,
      col = "red",
      lwd = 3)
```


# Approximate the Sampling Distribution of the Median

```{r}
meds <- NA
for (i in 1:N){
  samples <- rnorm(
    N, 
    mean = xbar,
    sd = sdbar)
  meds[i] <- median(samples)
}
hist(meds, breaks = 50, main = "Distribution of \nEstimated Medians", xlab = "Estimated Medians")
abline(v = mean(meds), lwd = 3, col = "red")
```

# 95% confidence interval

```{r}
quantile(meds, c(0.025, 1 - 0.025))
```
